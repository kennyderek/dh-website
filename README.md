I spent my time at [German House](http://dh.scripts.mit.edu/) which is a residence hall that prides itself in (among other things) its independence from dining halls! We have a highly coordinated system of shoppers, meal stewards, and rotating cookcrews that work together to feed our community of 30 people, using the recipes and menus (here is a [real  menu](https://dh.scripts.mit.edu/menu/2025-05-04/) and [real meal](https://dh.scripts.mit.edu/menu/meal/2939/) we ate, hosted on our own website!

Take a gander!
